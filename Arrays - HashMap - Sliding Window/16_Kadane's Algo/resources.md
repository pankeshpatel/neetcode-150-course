Kadane's Algorithm is a powerful tool for solving maximum subarray sum problems efficiently. 
Here’s how you can determine whether you should apply it to a given problem:

### Problem Characteristics
Kadane’s Algorithm is applicable when:

- You are dealing with `arrays or lists` of numbers.
- The problem asks for a `contiguous subarray` with maximum sum.
- The problem has `no constraints` on choosing an empty subarray.
- There are `negative numbers` involved, making naive summation difficult.



### Key Problem Statements That Suggest Kadane’s Algorithm
 - `Find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum.`
 - `Find the maximum possible sum of any subarray.`
 - `Determine the maximum sum of elements in a subarray where at least one element is chosen.`
 - `Find the largest possible gain (or profit) in a subarray.`
